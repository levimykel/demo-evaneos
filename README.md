## Demo project for Evaneos

This demo uses the base code from the [prismic-demo](https://github.com/arnaudlewis/prismic-demo).

Here are the [prismic repository](https://evaneos-demo2.prismic.io/) and the [live demo site](https://infinite-falls-69018.herokuapp.com/).


This doesn't have any sort of new or interesting slices. It uses the design from the current Evaneos website.

It contains two different pages: an Information page and an Article page.
